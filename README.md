# Analyzing Purple Air data

This repo contains R functions and scripts that could be useful in analyzing Purple Air data.
The main goal of this repo is to be able to help analyze Purple Air data and answer some basic questions about Purple Air performance. 
* Some questions we hope to answer are:
  + How do Purple Air sensors compare with nephelometers and FEM methods?
  + Are regional/local corrections required for better correlation between Purple Airs and nephs and/or FEM methods?
  + Are seasonal (summer/winter, wildfire/non-fire) corrections required for better correlation between Purple Airs and nephs and/or FEM methods?
  + What is the lifetime of the Purple Air sensors?
  + Do the Purple Air sensors show a zero drift?
  + Is there a way of readily identifying failing sensors?
